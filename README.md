# End-End-MLOPS-Proj

## Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for building a data science project from data cleaning to model deployment


## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following libraries installed:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- [any other libraries used]

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Saswankar1/End-End-MLOPS-Proj.git
   ```
2. Enter the directory
   ```
   cd End-End-MLOPS-Proj
   ```

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook or script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrix and ROC curve are used to assess the model's performance.
